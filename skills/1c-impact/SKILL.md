# 1c-impact — usages, call graph, change impact

Policy owner: `rules-1c/rules/mcp-first-search.md`. Another session MCP with the same graph or code-metadata capability takes the same priority; take argument names from its live schema. This skill maps the current Graph/Code deployment.

Evidence for `rules-1c/rules/verification-gates.md → Gate 4` and for the pre-refactor analysis of `rules-1c/rules/tooling-playbooks.md → Refactoring`. Refactoring blind when these servers are exposed is a defect; when they are not, follow Gate 4 graceful degradation.

All graph project-data calls require the explicit returned `project_id` bound to the current roots; substitute `<resolved-project-id>` in the examples. Reuse it for searches, impact, evidence and pagination, with verified layer provenance for an extension. Follow the live schema for tools without this selector and for code-server scope; use verified fixed/session/entity scope or another scoped route, never invent arguments (`rules-1c/rules/multi-contour-search.md`).

## Tools and exact arguments

| Need | Call (graph first) | Fallback (code) |
|---|---|---|
| What breaks if the object changes | `trace_impact(object_name, direction="downstream", depth=3, relationship_types?)` | `graph_dependencies(object_name, direction="both" \| "forward" \| "reverse", limit=50)` |
| Who calls / what is called | `trace_call_chain(routine_name, object_name?, direction="callers" \| "callees", depth=3)` | `get_method_call_hierarchy(method_name, direction="both", depth=3)` |
| Attributes that reference an object | `find_usages_of_object(object_name)` | `graph_dependencies(..., direction="reverse")` |
| Objects that use a type | `find_objects_using_object(object_name)` | same |
| Documents declaring movements into a register | `find_register_movement_docs(register_name)` or `get_register_writers(register, direction="incoming")` | `codesearch(query="Движения.<Регистр>")` (source evidence only) |
| Direct BSL access / targets shared by several objects | `find_object_referrers(object_name?, access?, min_referrers=1)`; `access="read"` / `"write"`, omit for both | Bounded `codesearch` then scoped native source search |
| Release-level transitive impact | `affected_subgraph(roots, max_depth?, direction?, edge_types?)` with entity references from `resolve_graph_entity` | — |

Object/call tools use `object_name`, `routine_name`, `register_name`, `method_name`; `get_register_writers` instead uses `register` / `document`. Do not invent aliases. Recorder movements and direct BSL access are separate relations: an independent register can have no recorders but still have BSL writers. `find_object_referrers` proves static access with file/line evidence; a record-set factory is write intent, not proof of a committed write.

## Configurations with extensions

When the graph covers the relevant base/extension layers: `list_graph_projects`, match the current roots, keep the base `project_id`, and never register extensions as projects. Repeat discovery only when workspace/server context changes or the mapping becomes invalid. Effective implementation in that index — `resolve_effective_entity(project_id, object_name, entity_kind="MetadataObject", entity_name?)`; what one indexed extension changed — `compare_base_and_extension(project_id, object_name, extension_name)`. Keep the base and extension comparison inside that same project. Neither a plain hit nor an indexed effective view alone proves what runs in a named infobase.

For separate indexes or missing graph layers, use each contour's mapped code tools or own files. Account for base, primary, secondary and relevant infrastructure contours before project-wide impact/absence claims; disclose missing coverage. Routing and runtime-evidence boundaries — `rules-1c/rules/multi-contour-search.md`.

## Rules

- Read `truncated`, `exhaustive` (including `data.exhaustive`), `degraded` and `warnings`; an exhaustive claim needs a complete page set, verified scope and current sources. `source_refresh.drift` invalidates a Graph freshness claim even when tasks are `completed`; removed metadata/forms can survive an incremental refresh. See the graph catalog's refresh boundaries before relying on an old hit or requesting maintenance.
- Callers of a public `Экспорт` routine are a promotion trigger (`rules-1c/rules/verification-policy.md`); the caller list belongs in the delivery evidence.
- Typed answers map to actions by code — `rules-1c/rules/mcp-policy.md → C. Server answers → actions`.

Evidence-first tools (`find_graph_path`, `explain_graph_evidence`, `compare_graph_scope`), domain relations (rights, subscriptions, DCS lineage): `skills/mcp-1c-tools/docs/1c-graph-metadata-mcp.md`.
