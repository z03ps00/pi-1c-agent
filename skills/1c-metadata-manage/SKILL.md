# 1C Metadata Manage — Skill Dispatch

Use this skill when the task involves **1C metadata structure** (creating, editing, validating, or removing configuration objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions, or databases).

## Hard rule

Any **mutation** of metadata XML — `Configuration.xml`, object XML, `Form.xml`, MXL / SKD layouts, `Role.xml`, subsystems, command interfaces — is executed **through this skill** (dispatch below → domain doc → PowerShell tools) or through the `1c-metadata-manager` subagent. The tools under `tools/` handle BOM, encodings, UUID regeneration, `ChildObjects` ordering and cross-references that are easy to break manually. Hand-editing these files while the skill is available is a **defect** (`AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents`), not a slower-but-acceptable alternative.

The same gate covers **infobase operations** (create / run, load / dump configuration, `/UpdateDBCfg`, web publication): use the `db-ops` / `web-ops` tools of this skill ([db-manage.md](docs/db-manage.md), [web-manage.md](docs/web-manage.md)) or the matching slash command (`/update1cbase`, `/loadfrom1cbase`, `/getconfigfiles`, `/deploy-and-test`) — never an ad-hoc `1cv8.exe` / `ibcmd` command line composed from memory. DB updates follow the iterative retry discipline (`db-manage.md → Update retry discipline`).

**Repository-bound projects:** when `.dev.env` `REPOSITORY_PATH` is set, the configuration is bound to a 1C configuration repository (хранилище) — objects must be **locked in the repository before** this skill mutates them and committed after verification, and repository operations themselves go through the `1c-repository-manage` skill (`C:/DevopsMoments/pi-agents/config-1c/skills/1c-repository-manage/SKILL.md`, process — its `docs/repo-sdlc.md`). A "configuration object is read-only / locked" failure in a mutating or DB-update run on such a project routes there, not into a retry loop. **Never unbind** the configuration from the repository to proceed (`AGENTS.md` / that skill's Safety invariant 5).

**EDT-format sources:** the tools of this skill address the **Designer XML dump** (`Configuration.xml`, object XML, `Form.xml`, MXL / SKD, `Role.xml`). A project developed in 1C:EDT (`.dev.env` `USE_EDT=true`) may instead keep its sources in **EDT format** — `.project`, `DT-INF/`, `src/**/*.mdo`, `Form.form` — which is outside this toolchain: never point these scripts at `src/`, and never hand-edit `*.mdo` / `*.form` as a workaround. Metadata mutations there go through EDT (EDT-MCP `create_metadata` / `modify_metadata` / `rename_metadata_object` / …, the EDT UI, or a confirmed export → XML → import round trip) per `C:/DevopsMoments/pi-agents/config-1c/rules-1c/rules/edt-workflow.md`. When the working tree **is** a Designer XML dump, this skill applies unchanged whether or not the humans edit it in EDT.

The only exceptions:

- **Unambiguous one-line fix** of an existing value that cannot break structure — a synonym / comment typo, a boolean flag flip on an existing element. Anything that adds / removes / reorders elements, touches UUIDs, or spans more than one line of XML is not "one-line".
- **Skill not available in the session** (files not installed / not exposed) — state it once in one line, then hand-edit with `metadata-xml-workarounds.md` loaded and validate per `verification-gates.md → Gate 5`.
- **Read-only analysis** of metadata XML is not a mutation — reading files directly is fine (subject to `mcp-first-search.md` for locating them).

## Vendor support gate

Every mutating tool of this skill refuses to edit an object of a **typical configuration on vendor support** that is locked ("на замке"), and refuses to delete one that has not been taken off support. This is not advisory: the run exits `1` with a diagnostic. Editing such an object directly breaks future vendor updates silently, so the refusal is the correct outcome, not an obstacle to route around by hand-editing the XML.

The default answer when a typical object needs a change is an **extension** (`cfe-borrow` / `cfe-patch-method`) — support state stays untouched and updates keep working. Deliberately changing support state is the `support-edit` tool. Both paths, plus the `SUPPORT_GUARD` modes in `.dev.env` (`deny` — default / `warn` / `off`), are in [support-manage.md](docs/support-manage.md).

In every case the post-edit validation (`verify_xml` / skill validation scripts) still applies. When reporting a task that mutated metadata / forms / layouts, name the path used in one line (`Metadata tooling: <tool / subagent>` or `hand-edit — <exception>`) per `AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents`.

## Path conventions

PowerShell examples in this skill (`SKILL.md` and every `docs/*.md`) use the prefix `skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`. That prefix is **relative to the active tool's skills directory**, not to the repository root:

- After installation: the script lives under `<tool>/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...` (e.g. `.cursor/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.claude/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.kilo/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`, `.ai-agent/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`). Active tools that load this skill resolve the prefix automatically.
- In the `1c-rules` source repository (when editing the skill itself): the same script lives under `C:/DevopsMoments/pi-agents/config-1c/skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/...`. Prepend `content/` when running the example outside of an installed project.

The same convention applies to `docs/*.md` references like `skills/1c-metadata-manage/tools/1c-skd-info/modes-reference.md`.

## Runtime selection — Windows / Linux / macOS

Each tool of this skill ships as a PowerShell script (`*.ps1`). Some tools additionally ship a **Python entry point** (`*.py`) next to it, with the same parameter names and the same contract:

**Exactly five commands have a Python entry point today.** They are listed here by file name; these are the only shipped Python command entry points (`tools/_common/dev_env.py` is a shared helper, not an additional command), and no tool outside this table may be assumed to work on Linux.

| Tool directory | PowerShell | Python | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1c-form-scaffold/scripts/` | `form-add.ps1` | `form-add.py` | creates a managed form (scalar registration + descriptor + `Ext/Form.xml` + module) |
| `1c-form-scaffold/scripts/` | `remove-form.ps1` | `remove-form.py` | `-DryRun` first, a real deletion needs `-Force` |
| `1c-form-compile/scripts/` | `form-compile.ps1` | `form-compile.py` | form DSL → `Form.xml` |
| `1c-meta-edit/scripts/` | `meta-edit.ps1` | `meta-edit.py` | `add-form` is refused in both runtimes — use `form-add` |
| `1c-meta-validate/scripts/` | `meta-validate.ps1` | `meta-validate.py` | also the mandatory post-edit check `meta-edit` runs |
| **every other tool under `tools/`** | `*.ps1` | **none** | **not ported** — needs Windows or `pwsh`; there is no `.py` peer to call |

Rules:

- **Windows** — run the `.ps1` (`powershell -NoProfile -File <script> …`). This is the reference runtime; the PowerShell scripts are the complete toolchain.
- **Linux / macOS** — run the `.py` with `python3` (`python3 <script> …`), same switches (`-ObjectPath`, `-FormName`, `-Force`, …). The ports need `lxml` (`python3 -m pip install lxml`). Installing `pwsh` makes the `.ps1` files launchable there, but the availability of a PowerShell host does not guarantee that a Windows-specific tool works on Linux or macOS: anything that relies on COM, platform binaries, or Windows paths and encodings can still fail under `pwsh`. Respect the platform requirements of the individual tool instead of assuming a blanket cross-platform guarantee.
- The two runtimes are **kept in parity by tests**, not by convention: `tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py` runs both and compares the results, and CI runs the Python suite on Linux without a PowerShell host.

**Upstream ships Python variants of commands that this package does not.** They live in `Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills` at the pinned commit `ecd289fe11733028d87b55284ea9fb5feff8f513` — immutable tree: <https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills/tree/ecd289fe11733028d87b55284ea9fb5feff8f513/.claude/skills> (for example the `cf-*`, `cfe-*` and `db-*` skills); attribution and local deltas: [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md). Those files are **not installed and not managed by this package's manifest**, and **not covered by our parity tests or by the local hardening** the five entry points above went through. They are therefore not a claim of full Linux / macOS support: do not install them automatically, and do not copy them over the five patched `.py` scripts here, which carry local fixes and would be silently overwritten. If you use one, take it from upstream deliberately, keep it outside the installed skill tree, and follow the platform instructions upstream gives for that specific tool. Their existence never makes hand-editing metadata XML acceptable.

**A missing runtime does not unlock hand-editing.** When a task needs a tool that has no Python entry point yet and no PowerShell host is available, that is a blocked task, not an exception to the Hard rule above — say so in one line and stop, or install `pwsh`. Silently hand-writing metadata XML because "the script would not run here" is the same defect as hand-editing with the tool available.

## Dispatch Strategy

Determine task complexity, then choose the execution mode:

### Direct execution — simple / read-only tasks

Use when the task is a **single lightweight query**: checking metadata info, a quick lookup, one validation call. In this case identify the task domain from the table below, read the corresponding file, and follow its instructions directly.

### Subagent delegation — complex / mutation tasks

Delegate to the **`1c-metadata-manager`** subagent (defined in `C:/DevopsMoments/pi-agents/config-1c/agents/1c-metadata-manager.md`, or in the installed agents directory for the active tool) when **any** of the following is true:

- The task **creates, scaffolds, or compiles** metadata (objects, forms, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, CF, CFE, databases)
- The task **edits multiple files** or **spans multiple domains**
- The task involves a **multi-step workflow** (create → edit → validate → fix → re-validate)
- The task requires **reading large domain docs** (forms, meta-manage, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, DB — each 200–800 lines)

The subagent already knows how to read the skill docs, execute PowerShell scripts, and validate results. Provide it with the full task description including object names, attributes, types, and any business context from the conversation.
