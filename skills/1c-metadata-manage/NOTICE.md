# Third-party notices — `1c-metadata-manage`

This skill vendors tool scripts from a third-party project. The notice below is
reproduced as the licence requires; it applies to the vendored files listed here
and travels with every copy of this skill, including installed ones
(`<tool>/skills/1c-metadata-manage/NOTICE.md`).

## Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills

- Upstream: <https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills>
- Pinned commit: `ecd289fe11733028d87b55284ea9fb5feff8f513`
- Licence: MIT

Vendored under `tools/`, with local modifications documented in each file's
header and in `docs/`:

**Python entry points — exactly five, all vendored from the pinned commit above.**
Each was taken from that immutable commit, not from a moving `HEAD`, and each
carries its downstream deltas in its own file header:

- `tools/1c-form-scaffold/scripts/remove-form.py` — Python runtime of
  `form-remove`. Downstream deltas: input validation (1C identifiers, no
  traversal / separators / UNC / symlinked targets), the `-DryRun` / `-Force`
  safety gate, path containment anchored at `-SrcDir` (a symlink or junction on
  any component of the chain is refused before the first mutation), a
  transactional mutation path whose quarantine is discarded only after every
  payload is verifiably back or the transaction has committed, and
  byte-preserving `ChildObjects` editing. Upstream base: v1.4.
- `tools/1c-form-compile/scripts/form-compile.py` — Python runtime of
  `form-compile`. Downstream deltas: one event normalizer for all three DSL
  spellings (`events`, `on` + `handlers`, standalone `handlers`), an explicit
  non-zero refusal when two spellings are given at once or an event name is
  unknown, and the corrected `OnEditEnd` → `ПриОкончанииРедактирования` suffix
  (upstream spells the key `OnEndEdit`, so the auto-name fell through).
- `tools/1c-form-scaffold/scripts/form-add.py` — Python runtime of `form-add`,
  the managed-form scaffolder. Downstream deltas: `.dev.env` support guard via
  `tools/_common/dev_env.py`, and XML escaping of the user-supplied `-FormName` /
  `-Synonym` in the generated descriptor (upstream interpolates them verbatim, so
  an ordinary `A & B` produced a descriptor no parser accepts).
- `tools/1c-meta-edit/scripts/meta-edit.py` — Python runtime of `meta-edit`.
  Downstream deltas: `add-form` is refused before any mutation and redirected to
  `form-add`, in every key spelling the dispatcher itself accepts and across the
  whole definition; the auto-validator is resolved under the downstream directory name
  (`1c-meta-validate`), its absence is a refusal raised *before* the edit is
  written, `-NoValidate` is the single explicit opt-out, and the validator's
  exit code propagates instead of being discarded.
- `tools/1c-meta-validate/scripts/meta-validate.py` — Python runtime of
  `meta-validate`. Downstream deltas: checks 6a–6d — a `ChildObjects/Form`
  registration must be a scalar reference (6a), it must resolve to
  `Forms/<Name>.xml` on disk (6b), that descriptor must parse as XML (6c), and the
  name it declares must be the name that was registered (6d).
- `tools/_common/dev_env.py` — not upstream code: the Python peer of the local
  `DevEnv.ps1`, so both runtimes read project parameters from `.dev.env`.

Everything else under `tools/` is PowerShell-only; **no other Python port is
shipped.** The pin above is not to be advanced without re-running
`tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py` and re-recording the deltas here.

- the PowerShell tool scripts under `tools/` synced from the same upstream
  (per-tool versions and local changes: `docs/*.md`, section "Upstream sync").

### `1c-uuid-check`

`tools/1c-uuid-check/scripts/uuid-check.ps1` is a port of
