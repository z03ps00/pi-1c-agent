# 1c-form-inspect — read forms before touching them

Read-only. Creating or editing `Form.xml` is the `1c-metadata-manage` skill (`docs/form-manage.md`, form-compile DSL); design rules — `rules-1c/rules/forms.md`. Hand-writing a form while the skill is available is a defect.

## Tools and exact arguments

| Need | Call | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| Similar existing forms as examples | `search_forms` (code) | `query`, `limit=10` |
| Element tree, bindings, commands, handlers | `inspect_form_layout` (code) | `object_name`, `form_name=""` (empty = default form) |
| Form artifact with provenance | `get_form_artifact` (code) | `object_name`, `form_name` or `artifact_id`, `include_ranges=true` |
| Graph view of a form | `get_form_structure` / `find_form_links` (graph) | Required `form_name`, optional `object_name`, `form_kind="any"` (`managed` / `ordinary` / `any`); explicit resolved `project_id` |
| XML rules of the target | `get_xsd_schema` (code) | `object_type="Форма"` (also `Справочник`, `Документ`, `Роль`, `СКД`, `Макет`; English aliases accepted) |
| On-disk format specification | `formatspec` (docs) | `name="1c-form-spec"` or `query="реквизиты формы"` |

Graph form tools use names, not `form_ref`. Keep the returned base `project_id` bound to the current roots and verify the relevant layer (`rules-1c/rules/multi-contour-search.md`). `find_form_links` resolves event/command handlers in that form's own module; an identically named routine elsewhere is not the handler.

## Calls

```json
{"tool": "search_forms", "args": {"query": "ФормаДокумента Реализация", "limit": 10}}
{"tool": "inspect_form_layout", "args": {"object_name": "Документ.РеализацияТоваровУслуг", "form_name": "ФормаДокумента"}}
{"tool": "get_form_structure", "args": {"project_id": "<resolved-project-id>", "object_name": "Документ.РеализацияТоваровУслуг", "form_name": "ФормаДокумента", "form_kind": "managed"}}
{"tool": "get_xsd_schema", "args": {"object_type": "Форма"}}
{"tool": "formatspec", "args": {"name": "1c-form-spec"}}
```

## Ordinary forms

`Forms/<Имя>/Ext/Form.bin` is a binary container: none of the XML routes see it. Read it with `unpack_ordinary_form(form_path, workspace_path)` and write it back with `build_ordinary_form(workspace_path, output_path, verify=true)` — the contract, workspace layout and the `verification.status == "match"` criterion are in `skills/v8unpack-cf/SKILL.md → Ordinary forms`. Never edit `Form.bin` directly.

## After the change

`verify_xml(xml_content, object_type="Форма")` plus the skill's `form-validate`; `syntaxcheck_file` on the regenerated form module — `1c-validate`. Typed answers map to actions by code — `rules-1c/rules/mcp-policy.md → C. Server answers → actions`.

Details: `skills/mcp-1c-tools/docs/1c-code-metadata-mcp.md → Forms`, `skills/mcp-1c-tools/docs/1c-graph-metadata-mcp.md → Forms`.
