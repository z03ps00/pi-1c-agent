# Managed-Form Layout Patterns

Design guidance for managed forms, distilled from typical 1C configurations. Use when building a form and the user's requirements do not spell out where elements go. This is layout knowledge — it applies whether the form is edited via the `1c-metadata-manage` skill, EDT, or Designer. It complements the entry point `forms.md` and the hand-editing gotchas in `metadata-xml-workarounds.md`.

Element and group names below (`ГруппаШапка`, `Отбор[Поле]`, …) are the conventional 1C identifiers — keep them in Russian as shown; they are real names, not prose.

## Where this standard lives

**The normative text of this file is not inlined here.** It is one document of the `1c-standards` collection on the Help MCP server (`1C-docs-mcp`):

```
standards(name="form-patterns")     # this standard, entire - the normal call
standards(query="<what you need>")  # only when unsure which rule governs
```

`standards` is the tool for this collection. `docsearch` / `docinfo` serve the platform documentation and cannot reach it, and **no tool of this server takes a `corpus` argument**. Name resolution, paging, budget, and what to do when the server is not exposed - **`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/help-corpus-retrieval.md`**.

**Retrieve before you apply.** Every section below is a heading with no body: acting on a section title without the text behind it is inventing the rule, not following it. Fetch the rule once by name rather than a query per section.

Pinned source, readable directly: <https://github.com/comol/ai_rules_1c/blob/410951e74fd3e6b7a763cf49757935b9a34d3f31/$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/form-patterns.md>

## Sections

Every heading this file has always had, reproduced so that existing `form-patterns.md` section references and anchor links still resolve - the same compatibility shape `dev-standards-core.md` uses. Each is a retrieval target, not a summary.
