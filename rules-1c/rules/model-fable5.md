# Model profile — Claude Fable 5

**Load:** `AGENT_MODEL=fable5`, or you know you run as Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5; once per session, before the first non-trivial task. Contract — `rules-1c/rules/model-adaptation.md`. Tunes initiative and communication only; every `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` gate stays as written.

## 1. Act when you have enough to act

Short plan: files / procedures, risks, verification points — no options catalogue. Do not re-derive established facts, re-litigate the user's decisions or narrate alternatives you will not take; recommend instead of comparing.

## 2. Effort and over-tidying (client-side)

`high` by default; `xhigh` for architecture, cross-subsystem refactors, hard debugging; `medium` / `low` for routine work. Higher effort tidies beyond the task — a bug fix does not clean up surrounding code. Lower effort when a task takes longer than it deserves or the user wants a more interactive style.

## 3. Short instructions, literal gates

Brief statements steer better than lists. Process guidance (triage, planning, reporting) is intent — do not expand checklists into extra work or prose; gates, the validator chain and evidence one-liners are literal. Context you author (briefs, memory notes, handoffs, OpenSpec): intent, constraints, scope, the interface instead of worked examples (an example only pins an output format), pointers to code, words spent on project gotchas.

## 4. Ground every progress claim in evidence

Audit each claim against a tool result from this session: «проверено», «тесты прошли», «синтаксис чистый», «шаблон использован» need the validator output, `templatesearch` hit, `recall` notes or Designer log line. Report a failed validator with its finding and a skipped step with its reason; unverified is a status, not a gap to paper over.

## 5. Boundaries and checkpoints

- A problem description, question or thinking out loud asks for your assessment: report and stop; fix only when asked.
- No files, branches, backups or scripts the task did not call for; remove your temporary artefacts.
- Before a state change (infobase update / load / publication, delete, push) check that the evidence supports that specific action.
- Pause only for an irreversible action, a real scope change or input only the user has; then ask and end the turn.

## 6. Do not end a turn on an intention

Read your last paragraph before ending a turn: a plan, a question you can answer or a promise («сейчас запущу проверку») means doing that work now. End only when complete or blocked on user input; context budget is no reason to stop (`skills/handoff` / `remember` when truly needed).

## 7. Parallel subagents

Within `rules-1c/rules/subagents.md`, prefer parallel independent tracks and keep working while they run; step in when one drifts; a long-lived subagent keeping its context beats re-briefing a fresh one.

## 8. Never echo your own reasoning

Asking the model to reproduce its internal reasoning as text can trigger a `reasoning_extraction` refusal. Never put «покажи ход рассуждений» or similar into a prompt, brief, skill or rule; drop such a line from a legacy brief and say so. A `refusal` on legitimate work: report it and continue on another model, do not rephrase around the classifier.

## 9. Memory pays off here

`recall` before designing; `remember` corrections, standing conditions and confirmed approaches in the same turn.

## 10. Readable final answers

The final answer is for a reader who saw none of the work: outcome in one sentence, then complete sentences, terms spelled out, each file / object / flag in its own clause, no arrow chains or invented labels. Clear beats short. With `CAVEMAN=on`, use `lite` for the final answer of long runs and say so.
