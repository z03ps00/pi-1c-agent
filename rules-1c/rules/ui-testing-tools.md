# UI testing tools — QA MCP, browser and desktop automation

**When to load this file:** before any UI check of a 1C infobase (`1c-tester`, `/deploy-and-test` Step 4, behavioural confirmation under `UI_TESTING`, ad-hoc checks), or when choosing / installing a UI-automation tool.

Whether a UI check runs at all is gated by `UI_TESTING` — canon: `dev-standards-env.md → "UI_TESTING — UI-testing mode"`. This file answers **which route** drives the check once it is allowed, and the **mandatory preflight** before the first browser action.

## Route order (hard)

1. **QA MCP (`1c-qa`)** — the main route for checks in the 1C interface. It drives the thin client's forms through the platform testing model and reads structured state. Eligible when `TOOL_QA` is not `off` and its `qa_*` / `ui_*` tools are exposed; it needs the project infobase (`INFOBASE_PATH`, `INFOBASE_ROLE`), not a web publication. Load `skills/1c-qa-testing/SKILL.md` and `rules-1c/rules/qa-testclient.md` (starting the test client, visible / hidden window, screenshots, data confirmation).
2. **Web client** — the fallback when QA MCP is absent, disabled, cannot connect or cannot cover a step, and the primary route for web-client-specific behaviour or a requested web screenshot. Needs `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL`; runs the preflight and driver order below, then `web-client-driving.md`.
3. **Windows-MCP** — windows outside the testing model (OS and file dialogs, platform error windows the test client does not reach, other applications) under the cautions of `qa-testclient.md → Windows-MCP`. It does not see 1C form controls and never drives forms that QA MCP or the web client can drive.

State the chosen route, and the reason for a fallback, once in the report. `TOOL_QA=required` with the server missing or failing blocks the check; the web client does not satisfy it. A route that cannot run leaves its scenarios unverified; never report them passed.

## Saved regression suites

`skills/1c-ui-regression/SKILL.md` provides optional reusable test authoring. The model may choose it when repeated coverage is useful. A saved suite runs through its verified project runner (for example Playwright Test), under `UI_TESTING`, the authorized dev/test target and `TOOL_BROWSER`. It is distinct from interactive inspection; it does not need agent-browser installation solely to execute saved assertions. `TOOL_BROWSER=off` disables this lane; `required` needs a working runner for the selected suite. Do not substitute another provider to bypass a disabled or required capability.

Any interactive exploration or debugging needed to author/fix the suite still follows the preflight and driver order below. Both lanes retain the interaction rules from `web-client-driving.md`; saved tests use observed stable locators rather than ephemeral snapshot refs.

## Preflight before web UI tests (hard gate)

Runs before an authorized interactive web UI test, once the web route is selected (saved suites use the preceding section). First apply `TOOL_AGENT_BROWSER`, `TOOL_BROWSER`, `TOOL_WINDOWS_MCP` (`rules-1c/rules/mcp-policy.md → Tool availability`). In `auto`, use the preflight below. With `TOOL_AGENT_BROWSER=off`, skip its probes/install question and select an eligible built-in browser. With `required`, a missing agent-browser blocks execution. If no permitted web driver works, report the web test unrun; do not substitute desktop automation for a web scenario. A selected built-in driver's `required` failure also blocks the test.

1. **Detect `agent-browser`.** Available if **either**:
   - CLI on `PATH` (`agent-browser --version` succeeds), **or**
   - its MCP tools are callable in the current session (e.g. `agent_browser_open`, `agent_browser_snapshot`).
2. **If available** — proceed with preference order below. No prompt.
3. **If missing — stop before any browser action** and ask the user in Russian (one message, do not bury it in prose):

   > Для веб-тестов 1С рекомендую поставить `agent-browser` — headless-браузер со снимками accessibility-дерева, сильно экономит токены по сравнению со скриншотами / vision. Установить сейчас через `/install-agent-browser`?  
   > - **да** — установлю и продолжу тесты  
   > - **нет** — продолжу на встроенном browser MCP (дороже по токенам)

4. **On «да» / yes / «установи»** — execute `/install-agent-browser` (`prompts/install-agent-browser.md`) fully, then continue UI tests with `agent-browser` (after client restart if MCP tools are still missing — tell the user once and pause until they confirm restart, or fall back only if they refuse to restart and explicitly allow the built-in browser).
5. **On «нет» / no / decline** — continue with an eligible built-in browser; otherwise report the test unrun. Do not ask again in the same session unless the user starts a new UI-test request.
6. **Autonomous / batch / no operator** — do not auto-install. Use an eligible built-in browser and state the fallback once; if none exists, report the test unrun. Never invent a screenshotter/OCR stack.

This gate does **not** change `UI_TESTING` or `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL`. It only ensures the cheap driver is offered before an expensive run.

Once a driver is chosen, load `web-client-driving.md` before the first action — it owns how the 1C web client itself behaves (snapshot reading, lists / trees / grids, reports, dialogs, anti-loop limits), independently of which driver won the preference order above.

## Web driver order (hard)

1. **`agent-browser`** (https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) — **default for 1C web client tests**. Use accessibility-tree snapshots (`snapshot` / MCP equivalents), refs (`@eN`), and typed interactions. Screenshots only for evidence in the test report, not as the primary observe loop. Install: `/install-agent-browser`.
2. **Built-in browser MCP** of the active client (`cursor-ide-browser`, Playwright / `browser-use`, etc.) — eligible fallback after the preflight above (agent-browser disabled, declined, or absent with no operator). Same human-like typing / TAB / wait rules as in `1c-tester`.
3. **`Windows-MCP`** (https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP) — **last resort**, Windows only: OS UI and windows outside the 1C client, never the web client's pages. Install: `/install-windows-mcp`.

Never invent a parallel stack (PowerShell screenshot loops, custom OCR, ad-hoc vision pipelines) while a tool from this list can cover the need.

## Token discipline

- Prefer **structured snapshots** (a11y tree / DOM refs) over images. Vision on full-page screenshots is the expensive path that `agent-browser` exists to avoid.
- Re-snapshot after navigation or DOM-changing actions; do not reuse stale refs.
- Keep MCP tool profiles small (`agent-browser mcp` default `core` profile). Escalate to `--tools all` only when a missing tool blocks the scenario.
- `UI_TESTING` decides whether a run happens — do not "warm up" a browser or start a test client outside an allowed run.
- QA MCP answers are already structured: read the window tree (`detail="lite"`) instead of screenshots, and screenshot key states only (`qa-testclient.md → Screenshots`).

## Windows-MCP — when and when not

| Use Windows-MCP | Do not use Windows-MCP |
|---|---|
| OS, file and platform error dialogs outside the testing model | Driving 1C forms — QA MCP does that, and the thin client exposes no controls to UI Automation |
| External Windows apps in the scenario | Routine checks of the **web** client at `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL` |
| User explicitly requires desktop automation | "Because screenshots feel easier", or as a substitute for publishing the web client |

When Windows-MCP is the chosen tool: drive it through its MCP tools; **do not** ask the model to code a screenshotter, template matcher, or OCR layer for the same job.

## Install commands

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| UI checks in the thin client | QA MCP: Docker image `comol/qa_mcp` from the MCP server distribution, client connection `1c-qa`; the ruleset's MCP installers do not set it up yet |
| Web UI testing, token-efficient browser | `/install-agent-browser` |
| Unavoidable Windows desktop automation | `/install-windows-mcp` |

Installing a tool does not change `UI_TESTING` or `TOOL_*` and does not set `INFOBASE_PUBLISH_URL`.

## Interaction rules (web tools)

Unchanged from `1c-tester` / `/deploy-and-test` Step 4:

- Human-like typing with short delays; TAB between fields.
- Wait for elements before interact / assert.
- Screenshot key states for the report (open, filled, saved/posted, errors) — evidence, not the observe loop.
