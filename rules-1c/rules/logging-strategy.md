description: Positive logging strategy for 1C — when to write to the event log, which severity levels and category names to use, structured payload via `ДанныеЖурналаРегистрации`, secrets / PII bans. Complements the bans in `dev-standards-code-style.md → "Forbidden Calls and Constructs"` and `dev-standards-architecture.md §3 → "Error Handling"`.

# Logging Strategy

`dev-standards-code-style.md → "Forbidden Calls and Constructs"` bans `ЗаписьЖурналаРегистрации` without an explicit task; `dev-standards-architecture.md §3 → "Error Handling"` bans empty `Попытка / Исключение`. This file is the **positive** companion: when logging *is* explicitly requested, this is how to do it.

<!-- help-mcp-router -->

## Where this standard lives

**The normative text of this file is not inlined here.** It is one document of the `1c-standards` collection on the Help MCP server (`1C-docs-mcp`):

```
standards(name="logging-strategy")     # this standard, entire - the normal call
standards(query="<what you need>")  # only when unsure which rule governs
```

`standards` is the tool for this collection. `docsearch` / `docinfo` serve the platform documentation and cannot reach it, and **no tool of this server takes a `corpus` argument**. Name resolution, paging, budget, and what to do when the server is not exposed - **`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/help-corpus-retrieval.md`**.

**Retrieve before you apply.** Every section below is a heading with no body: acting on a section title without the text behind it is inventing the rule, not following it. Fetch the rule once by name rather than a query per section.

Pinned source, readable directly: <https://github.com/comol/ai_rules_1c/blob/410951e74fd3e6b7a763cf49757935b9a34d3f31/$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/logging-strategy.md>

## Sections

Every heading this file has always had, reproduced so that existing `logging-strategy.md` section references and anchor links still resolve - the same compatibility shape `dev-standards-core.md` uses. Each is a retrieval target, not a summary.

## 1. When to log

## 2. Severity levels

## 3. Event-category naming

## 4. Structured payload

## 5. Error / exception logging

## 6. What MUST NOT go into the log

## 7. Rotation and retention

## 8. Companion rules
