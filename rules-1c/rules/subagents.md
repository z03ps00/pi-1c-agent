# Subagents — catalog and delegation rules

**When to load this file:** if a task feels large / multi-step / multi-module and you suspect it is worth delegating to a specialized subagent — read this file, check the availability of a suitable subagent in the table below, and decide whether to delegate or execute directly.

## Delegation principle

13 specialized subagents are available in the project. Prompt files live in `agents/` and use the `1c-` prefix:

| Subagent id | Source prompt file |
|---|---|
| `1c-explorer` | `agents/1c-explorer.md` |
| `1c-analytic` | `agents/1c-analytic.md` |
| `1c-planner` | `agents/1c-planner.md` |
| `1c-architect` | `agents/1c-architect.md` |
| `1c-arch-reviewer` | `agents/1c-arch-reviewer.md` |
| `1c-developer` | `agents/1c-developer.md` |
| `1c-metadata-manager` | `agents/1c-metadata-manager.md` |
| `1c-refactoring` | `agents/1c-refactoring.md` |
| `1c-performance-optimizer` | `agents/1c-performance-optimizer.md` |
| `1c-error-fixer` | `agents/1c-error-fixer.md` |
| `1c-tester` | `agents/1c-tester.md` |
| `1c-code-reviewer` | `agents/1c-code-reviewer.md` |
| `1c-doc-writer` | `agents/1c-doc-writer.md` |

**Delegate when at least one countable fact holds:**

First apply triage: standalone `docs-fix` and `quick-fix` tasks stay with the parent, including in economy mode. The thresholds below do not override those exceptions. Spec-authoring may delegate research and artifact drafting under `sdd-integrations.md`; it does not enter the implementation pipeline.

- the change touches **≥ 3 modules** or **≥ 2 metadata objects** (forms, layouts, roles and DCS schemas count as objects);
- an **independent read-only track** exists — exploration, impact listing or pattern search that `1c-explorer` can run while the parent continues, or a review the user explicitly requested;
- the task needs **≥ 5 files read** before the first edit or a **mechanical edit across ≥ 5 files** — the parent's context window is the bottleneck;
- `.dev.env` has `ORCHESTRATION=economy` (see below).

**Otherwise execute directly:** a single-file edit, or a full-cycle task under those thresholds, runs the 5-step Development Procedure from `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` plus the closing gate from `rules-1c/rules/verification-gates.md`. The pipeline in `subagent-pipeline.md` applies only when delegation is chosen here.

All 13 agents declare `allowParallel: true`. That licenses parallel **read-only** tracks; two mutating subagents run in parallel on one configuration only when their write scopes are provably disjoint — `subagent-pipeline.md → Stage 3`.

**Model profile.** The active-model profile (`AGENT_MODEL` in `.dev.env` — `rules-1c/rules/model-adaptation.md`) may tune **how eagerly** you delegate within these criteria: some models delegate too readily and their profile biases toward direct execution and low spawn counts, others sustain parallel subagents well and their profile encourages independent parallel tracks. The criteria above, the per-subagent "when NOT to call" column, the built-in-explorer ban, and every common obligation stay unchanged — a profile never adds a subagent the rules forbid, and never removes one they require. In particular, no profile authorises a subagent spawned to double-check your own work.

**Economy mode.** When `.dev.env` has `ORCHESTRATION=economy` (toggled by `/economymode`; empty / missing = `standard`), load `rules-1c/rules/orchestrator-economy.md`: delegation of execution becomes the default — the parent keeps decisions, specs, and verification, subagents do the reading and writing. Check the key when loading this file for a non-trivial task. The mode only widens delegation; every constraint of this file stays intact, and model selection still resolves from `SUBAGENT_MODEL_*` per tier.

## Host-tool built-in explorers (hard ban)

Cursor (and some other hosts) ship a **built-in** Explore helper — e.g. Cursor Task `subagent_type: "explore"` — with a fixed, non-overridable system prompt. That helper is **not** this project's explorer. It does not run the MCP-first fallback chain, does not prefer 1C graph / code-metadata tools, and does not return the structured report from `agents/1c-explorer.md`.

**Hard rule for the parent:**

1. For any delegated read-only exploration that matches the `1c-explorer` row in the catalog below — launch **`1c-explorer`** (source: `agents/1c-explorer.md`; installed custom agent under the active tool, e.g. `.cursor/agents/explorer.md`, `.claude/agents/explorer.md`, …).
2. **Do not** launch the host's built-in Explore / `explore` / generic codebase scout for that work. Prefer an explicit custom-agent invocation (`/1c-explorer …`, or the host's "use the 1c-explorer subagent" / Task launch by custom agent name) over a built-in `explore` type.
3. If the session's Task / subagent API only exposes built-in types and **cannot** start the installed `1c-explorer` — **do not** silently substitute built-in Explore. Either (a) run the exploration on the parent with MCP-first search, or (b) tell the user that `1c-explorer` is not launchable in this session. Falling back to built-in Explore is a defect.
4. `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` / project rules steer the **parent**; they do not rewrite the built-in Explore prompt — so "putting explore instructions in rules" is not a substitute for calling `1c-explorer`.

This ban is Cursor-shaped (built-in Explore is the common failure) but applies to **any** host-native generic explorer that bypasses the project agent prompt.

## Common obligations

Owned by `rules-1c/rules/subagent-core.md` — CONFUSION on material forks, MCP-first search, metadata / infobase / repository gates, validator chain, scope and done criteria, the Handoff block, report vocabulary, shell and SDD. Every subagent inherits `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` in full plus that file; every agent prompt opens with a one-line preamble pointing there. Parent agents and subagent authors must not weaken any item. Load it before writing a delegation brief or forwarding a Handoff.

## Subagent catalog

| Subagent | When to call | When NOT to call |
|---|---|---|
| **1c-explorer** | Read-only exploration across many files, metadata objects, dependencies, or "where/how/who calls" questions before planning, coding, or refactoring. **Mandatory** for delegated exploration — never the host built-in Explore (see *Host-tool built-in explorers*) | Narrow lookup that the parent can answer with one direct read/search; host-tool Cursor-guide / docs lookup (not 1C project source) |
| **1c-analytic** | User asks for a PRD, specification, or analysis of an existing area without writing code | Task is to write code |
| **1c-planner** | A multi-step implementation or refactoring plan is needed before coding | Task is small enough that the plan is 1–2 lines |
| **1c-architect** | Designing the architecture of a sizable modification (new subsystem, integration, multi-module change) | Single-procedure or single-module change |
| **1c-arch-reviewer** | User or pipeline stage 2 requests validation of an existing design, and the reviewer model gate below is satisfied | No architectural design exists yet; no explicitly selected reviewer model |
| **1c-developer** | Bulk code writing or modification across multiple modules that would otherwise drain the parent's context | Small local edit (Quick-fix path — see `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md → Development Procedure`) |
| **1c-metadata-manager** | Creating, scaffolding, compiling, or multi-step / multi-domain metadata operations (objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions) | Single info lookup or single XML attribute fix — use a direct edit or the `1c-metadata-manage` skill |
| **1c-refactoring** | Dead-code cleanup, consolidation, or deduplication across multiple modules | Refactor is local to one procedure |
| **1c-performance-optimizer** | User reports slowness, or query / loop optimization is the explicit task | No performance concern was raised |
| **1c-error-fixer** | Quick fix of syntax / runtime errors / BSL LS warnings without architectural changes (tier `coding` — it authors production code, often on transactional paths) | The fix requires architectural rework — escalate to `1c-architect` / `1c-developer` |
| **1c-tester** | Applicable UI verification with effective `UI_TESTING=essential` (important new or changed user-visible behaviour) or `auto`, or explicit UI-test request under `manual`; authorized dev/test target required (`dev-standards-env.md`) | No test infobase; purely static task; `off`, or `manual` without an explicit UI-test request |
| **1c-code-reviewer** | **Only when the user explicitly asks for a code review** and the reviewer model gate below is satisfied | Auto-triggering after edits is forbidden; no explicitly selected reviewer model |
| **1c-doc-writer** | User-facing documentation: user guides, admin manuals, tutorials, codemaps, API references | Inline code documentation (module / procedure headers) — that is the developer's responsibility |

## Tool declarations

Like `modelTier`, the `tools` frontmatter of a source agent file is an **abstract vocabulary**, not a host tool list: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Shell`, `MCP`. `Shell` means "may run shell commands" and `MCP` means "may call the project's MCP servers"; neither is a tool name in any AI client. The installer resolves the list into what the active tool actually understands — `disallowedTools` for Claude Code / Kimi / Qwen / ZCode / Command Code, `readonly: true` for Cursor, a `permission` object for OpenCode / MiMo Code, dropped entirely for hosts that have no per-agent tool control (`AGENT-INSTALL.md → Lean placement`, step 4).

Two consequences for anyone editing these files or diagnosing a subagent:

- **Read the source list as capabilities, not as the session's tool inventory.** An installed agent may legitimately see more tools than its source list names (it inherits the parent pool minus the denied capabilities). What the list guarantees is the other direction: a capability the list withholds is denied.
- **Never "fix" a subagent by deleting its `tools` line.** That is how the read-only agents (`1c-explorer`, `1c-code-reviewer`, `1c-arch-reviewer`) lose their write and shell boundary and end up guarded by prompt text alone. If an installed agent is missing shell or MCP, the installer mapping is what needs re-running.

## Model-tier routing

Host limitation: the new Kimi Code runtime ignores custom-agent `model` fields. Its adapter drops the resolved model hint; `SUBAGENT_MODEL_*` cannot select per-agent models there. Command Code needs `tools: "*"` plus native `disallowedTools` to inherit MCP while preserving read-only roles. Follow the adapter, not another client's defaults.

Subagent source files do **not** hard-code model names. Each agent declares an abstract tier in its frontmatter — `modelTier: coding`, `modelTier: analysis`, or `modelTier: light` — and the installer resolves the tier into a concrete model from `.dev.env` (`SUBAGENT_MODEL_CODING` / `SUBAGENT_MODEL_ANALYSIS` / `SUBAGENT_MODEL_LIGHT`, all Defaulted: empty = the AI client's default model; see `dev-standards-env.md → "Subagent model parameters"`). Model names live only in project settings, never in rules or agent prompts. On first install the installer proposes a benchmark-based profile (`Balanced` / `Economy` / `Quality`, derived from <https://onec-llm-bench.lovable.app/>); the recommendation lives in the installer / `.dev.env`, not here.

The three tiers:

- **`coding`** — code / metadata authorship and design: writing or editing BSL and metadata, architecture design, error fixes. Agents: `1c-developer`, `1c-metadata-manager`, `1c-architect`, `1c-performance-optimizer`, `1c-refactoring`, `1c-error-fixer`. Warrants the strongest model — this tier mutates production code.
- **`analysis`** — reasoning without production-code authorship: planning, analysis, review, testing, documentation. Agents: `1c-planner`, `1c-analytic`, `1c-arch-reviewer`, `1c-code-reviewer`, `1c-doc-writer`, `1c-tester`. A strong-value model is usually enough.
- **`light`** — small bounded read-only tasks where a cheaper / faster model saves limits without hurting quality: repo scouting, search, impact lists, mechanical post-edit checks. Agent: `1c-explorer`. Bounded edits may still be routed down per invocation (below), but no code-writing agent declares this tier.

Routing rules:

- **Good candidates for the `light` tier** (when the active tool supports a per-invocation model override, the parent may route these down even to a `coding`-tier agent): initial project-source scouting and candidate lists; navigation / reference gathering for objects, modules, forms, procedures; impact lists ("where is X used"); mechanical verification after edits; small bounded edits in strictly assigned files.
- **Never use the `light` tier as the final authority** for architecture, metadata / form design, transactions, registers, complex queries, security, data integrity, or release-critical decisions. Output of a light-tier run is working material, not a source of truth — the parent agent owns decomposition, source boundaries, the final decision, verification, and integration.
- **Do not delegate trivial single-step tasks at all** — the launch overhead exceeds the saving.
- The tier system does not change validation obligations: whatever tier produced the change, the applicable validator chain and closing gate from `verification-gates.md` still apply, including quick-fixes.

## Reviewer model gate

`1c-code-reviewer` and `1c-arch-reviewer` are **disabled unless a reviewer model is explicitly selected**: a non-empty `SUBAGENT_MODEL_ANALYSIS` in `.dev.env`, or a concrete model explicitly chosen by the user for this review invocation. An absent file / key, an empty value, the client's default model, and the legacy fallback to `SUBAGENT_MODEL_CODING` do not enable reviewers. Do not ask for a model merely to complete an ordinary development task.

Before dispatch, confirm that the active client's reviewer definition or supported invocation override selects that model. A setting that has not been rendered into the installed agent is insufficient; never silently substitute inheritance or another model. This is a launch condition, not a change to installer tier resolution for other agents.

When the gate is not satisfied, skip the review subagent. If the user requested a review, the parent performs it directly and states that no separate reviewer ran; do not replace it with another subagent. A pipeline-only architectural review is omitted. An explicitly selected model does not itself trigger a review: the catalog's request conditions still apply.

This gate does **not** disable `review_1c_code`, other MCP validators, the parent's spec-compliance check, or full-cycle review by the parent (`verification-delivery.md → Soft gate C`).

## Bounded sidecar task templates

When delegating, the launch prompt must make the task **bounded and self-contained**. Every delegation prompt includes:

- **bounded responsibility** — one verifiable goal, not "help with the task";
- **allowed and forbidden sources** — which MCP servers / files to use; the MCP-first search discipline (`mcp-first-search.md`) applies to subagents too;
- **read/write scope** — explicitly read-only, or an explicit list of files the subagent may edit;
- **expected output format** — what the report must contain;
- a reminder that the subagent **is not alone in the codebase**: it must not revert or overwrite changes outside its scope and must not delete files without an explicit instruction.

Reusable templates (fill in `<...>`; they slot into the matching subagent from the catalog):

### explorer-impact — read-only impact analysis (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only impact analysis. Find all references to <object / procedure / attribute>.
Follow the project MCP fallback chain (graph metadata → code metadata → scoped Grep after a bounded miss).
Thoroughness: <quick | medium>. Do not edit files.
Return: locations with file/line references and qualified 1C names, usage categories
(call / query / RLS / form / subscription), risky dependencies, and gaps you could not verify.
```

### explorer-patterns — find existing implementations (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only pattern search. Find existing implementations similar to <task>.
Prefer templatesearch / ssl_search / search_code over raw grep. Do not edit files.
Return: 3–7 best examples with paths and qualified names, which pattern to reuse, and what NOT to copy.
```

### metadata-scout — inspect an object / form before a change (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only metadata/form scout. Inspect <metadata object / form / layout> via get_object_dossier /
get_metadata_details / inspect_form_layout; confirm against the source XML/BSL when in doubt.
Do not edit files. Return: object structure, form elements / commands / events, related modules,
validation risks, and a suggested write scope for the implementation step.
```

### worker-bounded-edit — implementation within fixed boundaries (`1c-developer` / `1c-error-fixer`)

```text
Bounded implementation. You are not alone in the codebase; do not revert or overwrite edits
outside your scope. Edit only: <files>. Implement <specific change> per the approved plan.
Follow project rules (dev-standards-code-style, module-structure). For BSL select the applicable
gates and budget from verification-policy.md using the supplied task path, depth and risk;
run selected validators in syntaxcheck → check_1c_code → review_1c_code order.
For metadata XML run verify_xml; embedded/generated BSL also needs its applicable BSL gates.
Return: changed files, diff summary against the plan, checks performed, unresolved risks.
```

### reviewer-risk — independent review (`1c-code-reviewer`, **only when the user explicitly asked for a review and the reviewer model gate is satisfied**)

```text
Independent review of the current change for bugs, regressions, missing checks, and project-rule
violations. Review scope: <parent-provided git diff and/or explicit file list>. Do not edit files.
The reviewer has no Shell and must not infer an absent scope. High-confidence
findings only, ordered by severity, with file/line references; then residual risk.
```

### smoke-check — mechanical post-change verification (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only smoke check. Verify that <feature / rule / artifact> is discoverable and consistent through
its intended entry points (referenced paths exist, names match, wiring is complete). Do not edit files.
Return: exact checks performed, observed result, pass/fail per item.
```
