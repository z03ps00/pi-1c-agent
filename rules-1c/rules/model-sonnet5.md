# Model profile — Claude Sonnet 5

**When to load this file:** `AGENT_MODEL=sonnet5` in `.dev.env`, or you know you are running as Claude Sonnet 5. Load once per session, before the first non-trivial task. Routing, precedence and the invariants this file may not touch — `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/model-adaptation.md`. Everything below tunes **initiative and communication only**; every hard gate of `AGENTS.md` stays exactly as written.

Baseline: Sonnet 5 runs this ruleset well without tuning, and is more agentic than Sonnet 4.6 by default. The items below are the documented behaviours that most often need it.

## 1. Literal instruction following — state scope explicitly

Sonnet 5 reads instructions literally and does **not** silently generalise one item to another or infer a request that was not made. That is precision, not laziness, and it changes how you write briefs.

- When a task spans several objects, state the scope for **each**: "перепроверь все три модуля из списка, не только первый", "примени маркеры изменения ко всем правкам типового кода в этом файле". A brief that names one example and expects the pattern to spread will get exactly the one example.
- The same when briefing subagents (`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/subagents.md → Bounded sidecar task templates`): enumerate the files / objects / checks in scope, and say explicitly what is out of scope.
- Apply the same literalism to this ruleset when you read it: when a rule says "load X before Y", load X. Do not treat a mandated step as a suggestion because the task feels small — triage (`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/verification-policy.md`) is what decides size, not intuition.
- Ambiguity handling is unchanged: material fork → `CONFUSION`; low-risk ambiguity → state the assumption in one line and proceed (`rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` → Development Procedure → 1`).

## 2. Effort calibration (client-side setting)

- `high` is the default and the right setting for BSL / metadata work. Raise to `xhigh` for the hardest coding and agentic tasks (multi-module refactor, architecture, metadata surgery, hard debugging).
- Sonnet 5 respects effort **strictly**, especially at the low end: at `low` and `medium` it scopes work to exactly what was asked. Good for cost, but on a moderately complex task `low` risks under-thinking. Do not use `low` for a full-cycle change; keep it for docs-fix, triage and lookups.
- If you see shallow reasoning on a hard problem, the fix is **raising effort**, not padding the prompt. When effort must stay low for latency, add one targeted line: "это многошаговая задача, продумай последовательность до начала правок".
- Cross-model note for anyone porting settings: Sonnet 5 at `medium` is comparable to Sonnet 4.6 at `high`, and `high` to Sonnet 4.6 at `max`.

## 3. Keep adaptive thinking on

Adaptive thinking is on by default on Sonnet 5 (a change from Sonnet 4.6). **With thinking disabled the model reaches for tools noticeably less** — which directly breaks the MCP-first discipline this ruleset is built on (`rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` → MCP Tool Calling`, `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/mcp-first-search.md`).

- Keep thinking on. If cost is the concern, lower `effort` instead of turning thinking off.
- If thinking is off for reasons outside your control, compensate explicitly: name the required MCP calls in the plan before you start, and treat every skipped call as a defect to report rather than an economy.
- If the model produces thinking blocks more often than the work warrants (large system prompts can cause this), the steer is "думай только когда это меняет качество ответа; на простых вопросах отвечай сразу" — not disabling thinking.
- Note for whoever configures the client: manual extended thinking (`budget_tokens`) is removed on Sonnet 5, and `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` are rejected — tone and variety come from instructions, not sampling.

## 4. Progress updates and verbosity

- Sonnet 5 already gives regular, well-calibrated updates during long agentic runs. Do **not** add scaffolding that forces interim summaries ("итог после каждых трёх вызовов") — it is redundant here. Keep the evidence one-liners the ruleset requires (`Template:`, `Memory:`, `Metadata tooling:`, `IB tooling:`).
- Response length tracks task complexity on this model: short answers on lookups, longer on open analysis. That is the wanted behaviour; if a specific answer runs long, ask for concision on that answer rather than installing a global brevity rule.

## 5. Review tasks — brief for coverage

Sonnet 5 honours a stated severity bar more faithfully than earlier models: "only high-severity" makes it investigate just as deeply and then **withhold** the lower-severity findings.

- When you review BSL yourself or brief `1c-code-reviewer` / `1c-arch-reviewer`: ask for every finding, with severity and confidence attached, and filter in your own report. Never write "only critical", "be conservative" or "не мелочись" in the brief.
- If you do want a single-pass self-filter, define the bar concretely ("сообщай всё, что может привести к неверному поведению, ошибке проведения или неверному результату; опускай только чисто стилевые придирки") instead of a qualitative word like "important".
- Gate semantics are unchanged: `critical` / `error` from `check_1c_code` / `review_1c_code` block per `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` → MCP Tool Calling → B.1`.

## 6. Token budget and context

Sonnet 5 tracks its remaining context window (context awareness), and its tokenizer emits roughly 30% more tokens than Sonnet 4.6 for the same text.

- **Do not wrap up work early because context feels tight.** Finish the task; when the window genuinely runs short, save state first — `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills/handoff` for a session handoff, `remember` for facts worth keeping (`rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` → Project memory) — then continue or hand off cleanly.
- Spend the budget on evidence that matters: keep MCP queries narrow (`detail_level="L0"`, `names_only`, `project_name` / category filters per `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` → MCP Tool Calling → C.3`) instead of pulling whole modules "to be safe". This is the same rule as always; on this model the cost of ignoring it is higher.
- In `ORCHESTRATION=economy`, the offloading of reading to subagents (`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/rules-1c/rules/orchestrator-economy.md`) is a good fit with this constraint — but delegation criteria are unchanged.
