# Model profile — GPT-6 Astra

**Load:** `AGENT_MODEL=gpt6`, or you know you run as GPT-6 Astra; once per session, before the first non-trivial task. Contract and invariants — `rules-1c/rules/model-adaptation.md`. Tunes initiative and communication only; every `rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md` gate stays as written.

The model follows contextual instructions closely: broad skill triggers, rigid recipes and unclear approval boundaries make it load irrelevant guidance, over-verify or stop early.

## 1. Follow-through — finish authorized work

Define completion before acting: deliverable, applicable checks, requested execution or inspection, stopping boundary. Persist until met; a first implementation is not completion while verification or requested follow-up remains.

- "Can you…", "help me…", "I want…" (and Russian equivalents) are instructions to do the work, not to acknowledge capability or offer a plan.
- Within the resolved scope, complete implementation and applicable verification; fix failures your change caused within budget. No review stop after a first draft unless asked or gated.
- Before asking approval for a final action, prepare the reviewable result with already authorized work. A material fork stops dependent work only.
- `CONFUSION` stays for material forks (`rules-1c/AGENTS-UPSTREAM.md → Development Procedure → 1`). Before asking again, check whether the session already authorizes the exact action and scope; destructive actions still need their own confirmation. No invented warnings, disclaimers, approval flows or checklists for hypothetical risk.

## 2. Skills and rules — relevance over keywords

- Judge a skill by its workflow and activation condition, not a shared keyword or emphatic description. Honour explicit user selection and mandatory tool routing; for a multi-workflow skill read the root router, then only the material for the selected operation.
- If a skill makes you ask permission, pause, leave work unfinished or diverge from intent, name the `SKILL.md`, quote the line and say whether it is a requirement or your reading of a guideline.
- Load only what triage selects (a typo fix needs no repository map); mandatory startup reads and evidence gates stay.
- An obligation restated in several files is one obligation; resolve a real conflict by the precedence chain, never by averaging. A routine exception is not a new approval requirement: check whether it applies and whether authorization already exists.

## 3. Writing style

Default answers run long, list-heavy and formulaic. Lead with the outcome in concise paragraphs; lists only for genuinely parallel, sequential or comparable items; no nested lists, slop openers or closers, unrequested "X, not Y" contrasts or invented hyphenated labels. Delivery report: outcome, files, material caveats; no extra sections.

## 4. Delegation

The model under-delegates: when independent work can run in parallel and `rules-1c/rules/subagents.md` allows it, delegate. Briefs are intent-level (goal, constraints, scope, done-when) and human-readable, not telegram. Under `ORCHESTRATION=economy` the mode's routing wins.

## 5. Verification — proportionate to completion

Run the gates `verification-policy.md` requires and the checks the completion criteria need; once they pass, stop unless a new change, a failure or an unresolved concern justifies more. Mandated validators are not a licence for a self-review pass or a verifier subagent.

## 6. Reasoning effort and client levers

- `reasoning.effort` has no `none`: `low` for docs-fix and lookups; `medium` for quick-fix BSL and routine metadata; `high` for full-cycle; `xhigh` / `max` for architecture, cross-subsystem refactors and hard debugging.
- Fast mode is unavailable with EU data residency — leave it off there.
- Mid-turn steering, `configuration_update` for effort, async tool calling and pro mode are the user's choices: recommend in one line when clearly useful, then proceed.
