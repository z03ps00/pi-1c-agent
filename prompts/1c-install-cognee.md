description: Install Cognee MCP as optional persistent agent memory and register it in the active AI client

# /install-cognee — install Cognee persistent memory

Installs the official `cognee/cognee-mcp` server and exposes the focused memory API (`remember`, `recall`, `forget`) to the active AI client.

Use Cognee for general cross-session or cross-client memory. It is optional: the purchased 1C MCP bundle already provides project-scoped vector memory through `1c-templates-mcp`. Keep the server id `cognee-memory` so the two memory providers remain distinguishable.

Official sources:

- `https://docs.cognee.ai/cognee-mcp/mcp-quickstart`
- `https://docs.cognee.ai/cognee-mcp/mcp-local-setup`
- `https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee/tree/main/cognee-mcp`

## Default deployment

Use one local Docker HTTP server by default. It avoids file-lock contention from several editor windows spawning separate stdio processes, keeps one shared memory store, and fits the Docker-based 1C MCP bundle. Bind it to loopback only on host port `8010`, because the 1C Code MCP commonly occupies port `8000`.

Ask one deployment question:

> Install Cognee as the recommended local Docker service, connect an existing remote Cognee endpoint, or use a source checkout with stdio?

If the user has no preference, choose local Docker. Never send an LLM, embedding, Cognee Cloud, or backend API key to chat logs, command output, source control, or `memory.md`.

## Local Docker steps (recommended)

### 1. Detect and collect settings

1. Confirm Docker is available and running:

   ```powershell
   docker version
   docker compose version
   ```

2. Default installation root:
   - Windows: `C:\Work\CogneeMemory`
   - Linux/macOS: `~/.local/share/cognee-memory`

   Allow a different absolute path. The root must contain:

   ```text
   .env                 # secrets; never commit or print
   data/system/         # databases and graph
   data/files/          # ingested data/session cache
   install.manifest.json
   ```

3. Ask for the model/embedding provider settings Cognee needs. The simplest default is `LLM_API_KEY`; accept provider-specific variables when the user deliberately chooses another provider. Explain that Cognee needs both completion and embedding capability. Obtain explicit consent before persisting keys in `.env`.

4. If a `cognee-mcp` container or `cognee-memory` client entry already exists, inspect it. Do not overwrite or delete an existing memory store. Offer repair/update instead.

### 2. Create secret and data files

Create the directories and a UTF-8 `.env` without printing its contents. At minimum it contains the selected provider credentials plus:

```dotenv
SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY=/data/system
DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY=/data/files
COGNEE_MCP_TOOL_MODE=minimal
TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```

Restrict `.env` permissions to the current user where the OS supports it. Add the absolute `.env` path and installation root to the local project's ignore rules only when they fall inside a repository.

Write `install.manifest.json` without secrets. Record the image reference, resolved image digest from `docker image inspect`, host port, container name, endpoint, installation time, and data directories.

### 3. Pull and start

Use the official image. Preserve data through the bind mount and preserve the service across reboots:

```powershell
$root = 'C:\Work\CogneeMemory' # replace with the confirmed absolute path
$envFile = Join-Path $root '.env'
$data = Join-Path $root 'data'

docker pull cognee/cognee-mcp:main
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'Failed to pull cognee/cognee-mcp:main' }

docker run -d --name cognee-mcp --restart unless-stopped `
  --env-file $envFile `
  -e TRANSPORT_MODE=http `
  -p 127.0.0.1:8010:8000 `
  -v "${data}:/data" `
  cognee/cognee-mcp:main
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'Failed to start cognee-mcp' }
```

On Linux/macOS, use the equivalent shell syntax with the confirmed absolute paths. Do not publish the port on `0.0.0.0` by default.

If the container name already exists, do not remove it blindly. Inspect it and ask before replacing the container; replacing the container is safe only after confirming the bind-mounted data path.

### 4. Verify

Cognee may need time for migrations on first start. Check logs without exposing environment variables, then poll for at most two minutes:

```powershell
docker logs --tail 100 cognee-mcp
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:8010/health' -TimeoutSec 10
```

Failure to become healthy is an install failure. Report the last relevant log lines with secrets redacted.

### 5. Register the active client

Merge, never replace, an HTTP MCP entry named `cognee-memory` pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8010/mcp`. Detect the client and use its native schema, following the same path/merge rules as `/installmcp` and `/install-agent-browser`.

Canonical `mcpServers` fragment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cognee-memory": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8010/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For clients that reject `type`, keep only the accepted `url`. For OpenCode use its strict remote schema; for Codex use the corresponding `[mcp_servers.cognee-memory]` TOML table. Preserve all unrelated settings and MCP entries.

Restart the AI client and verify that `remember`, `recall`, and `forget` are exposed under the `cognee-memory` server namespace. Store and recall one harmless test note, then delete that test note/dataset if the API supports precise cleanup.

## Existing remote endpoint

Ask for the Streamable HTTP URL and optional bearer token. Verify `/health` when available, merge the client entry, and store any token only in the client's supported secret/environment mechanism. Do not copy a bearer token into project files unless the user explicitly accepts that storage.

## Source stdio mode

Use only when Docker is unavailable or the user explicitly wants a source checkout. Follow the official local setup: clone `https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee.git`, enter `cognee-mcp`, install `uv`, run `uv sync --dev --all-extras --reinstall`, and register `uv --directory <absolute-cognee-mcp-path> run cognee-mcp --tool-mode minimal` as stdio.

Pin `SYSTEM_ROOT_DIRECTORY` and `DATA_ROOT_DIRECTORY` to stable absolute paths. Warn that multiple clients spawning stdio against the same embedded graph can contend on its file lock; prefer one HTTP process for shared use.

## Update and removal

- Update: pull a newer image, record its digest, recreate only the container with the same `.env` and data bind mount, then verify health. Never delete the data directory as part of update.
- Disable: stop the container and disable/remove only the `cognee-memory` MCP entry.
- Delete memory: destructive and separate from uninstall. Require explicit confirmation naming the exact data directory before removing it.
