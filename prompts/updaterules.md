# /updaterules — update 1c-rules in a 1C project

This command is for 1C **projects** that use `.ai-rules.json` / `install.ps1`. To review Comol updates for **this Pi profile**, use `/review-airules` instead. To refresh **this profile** from the owner’s git remote, use `/update-profile`. Do not run `install.ps1` against the profile tree.

Source: `https://github.com/comol/ai_rules_1c`.

Action: update managed files in the current installation to the latest repository version (on-demand rules, subagent descriptions, slash commands, SKILL packages, MCP config, OpenSpec bundle, rendered `AGENTS.md`). Preserve:

- `USER-RULES.md`, `memory.md`, and `LLM-RULES.md` — one-time templates, never overwritten (a missing `LLM-RULES.md` on an older install is placed by this update);
- contents of `openspec/specs/` and `openspec/changes/` — copied in skip-if-exists mode;
- any managed file marked `userModified: true` in `.ai-rules.json`.

## Steps

1. Make sure `.ai-rules.json` exists at the project root. If it is missing, this is a first install: run `init` by `AGENT-INSTALL.md`, not `/updaterules`.

2. **Prefer the PowerShell channel** from the project root. `install.ps1` expects a local path in `-Source`, so first clone or update the source into a cache under `$env:TEMP`:

```powershell
$src = Join-Path $env:TEMP '1c-rules'
if (Test-Path (Join-Path $src '.git')) {
    git -C $src fetch --depth 1 origin HEAD
    git -C $src reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
} else {
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/comol/ai_rules_1c.git $src
}
& "$src\install.ps1" update -Source $src -AssumeYes
```

The PowerShell channel applies every adapter frontmatter transform (including OpenCode `toolsToPermission`) and runs the OpenCode agent frontmatter gate before reporting success. Prefer it over the agent channel whenever `git` / PowerShell are available.

3. Check installer output:
   - `Update complete.` — success;
   - `User-modified files detected: N` / files left at previous version — local edits preserved; use `-Force` / `-ForcePaths` only when the user wants the shipped version;
   - `Verification OK` / `Verification found N mismatch(es)` — hash check of freshly placed files;
   - `OpenCode agent frontmatter OK` — OpenCode gate passed (or skipped when `.opencode/agent/` is absent);
   - `OpenCode agent frontmatter INVALID` / exit code 1 — **update failed the hard gate** (see Step 5). Do not treat the run as successful.

4. If PowerShell is unavailable (restricted environment, no `git`/`pwsh`), execute *Update / add / remove* from `AGENT-INSTALL.md` through the agent channel: re-place managed files from the updated clone, re-render `AGENTS.md`, and update `version` and `updatedAt` in `.ai-rules.json`. Do not touch `USER-RULES.md`, `memory.md`, or `LLM-RULES.md` (place the latter from the template only if absent).

   **OpenCode hard obligation on the agent channel.** When `opencode` is an active tool (or `.opencode/agent/` exists), every placed agent file **must** go through `adapters/opencode.yaml → agents.frontmatter.toolsToPermission` before write-back: convert the source `tools` array into a `permission` object, then apply `keep` / `drop` / `rename` / `addIf` so that `tools`, `modelTier`, `isSubagent`, and `allowParallel` are **not** left in the file. Copying `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/1c-*.md` into `.opencode/agent/` verbatim is a defect — OpenCode rejects a `tools` array and will not start. Canon — `AGENT-INSTALL.md → OpenCode agents: tools array → permission object`.

5. **Mandatory post-update gate (both channels).** After the update, if `.opencode/agent/` or `.opencode/agents/` exists, verify that **no** agent markdown still has a `tools` **array** in its YAML frontmatter:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .opencode\agent, .opencode\agents -Filter *.md -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  ForEach-Object {
    $raw = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    if ($raw -match '(?ms)\A---\r?\n.*?^tools:\s*\[') {
      "FAIL: $($_.FullName)"
    }
  }
```

   - Any match → **update is incomplete / failed**. Report FAIL, list the files, and repair by re-running the PowerShell channel with `-ForcePaths .opencode/agent/*` (or re-applying `toolsToPermission` correctly on the agent channel). Do not tell the user the update succeeded.
   - Optional live check when `opencode` is on PATH: `opencode agent list` must not print `Configuration is invalid` / `Expected object | undefined, got [...] tools`.
   - If neither OpenCode agent directory exists → skip this gate.

6. Recommend restarting the AI client (OpenCode in particular) so it re-reads agent definitions and MCP config.

7. Compare the installed `install*.md` command names from the pre-update manifest with the updated ruleset. If one or more tool installers were added, show their names and execute `installtools.md` as the next procedure in the same interactive agent task. A PowerShell-only run cannot start a new AI command, so its report must tell the user to restart and run `/installtools`. The general command owns the MCP bundle question and all optional-tool choices; do not invoke `/installmcp` separately from this post-update flow. If no installer was added, do not interrupt the user with the tool menu.

## Parameters

- `-AssumeYes` — answers "yes" to confirmations and keeps user edits (`keep`) on conflicting files. For a fully automated run (CI), add `-NonInteractive`.
- `-Force` / `-ForcePaths .opencode/agent/*` — overwrite drifted / broken OpenCode agent files with the correctly transformed shipped versions.
- `-Tools cursor,claude-code` — not needed: active tools are read from `.ai-rules.json`.
